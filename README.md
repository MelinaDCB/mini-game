Hello, this is a Readme

app.rb is the 1.0 version of that OOP game.
Two bots just fight each other until one of them die.

app2.rb is the 2.0 version of the same game.
You, as a player, fight against two bots and you get to look for a better weapon and even heal yourself, if you've sustained too much damage, by looking for a health pack.

app3.rb is the 3.0 version of the game. If you're my corrector, the game isn't fully finished yet it's working well and just missing the last functionality.
You get to input a name for your player character and fight against 4 AI. 

Good luck !
